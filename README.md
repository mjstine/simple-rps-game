## What is the Rock, Paper, Scissors Game?

The Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a simple yet engaging game where two players choose from three possible options: rock, paper, or scissors. Each choice can either defeat or be defeated by another choice. In this project, you'll be playing against the computer, testing your luck and decision-making skills.

## Why I Started This Project

As a passionate developer, I created the Rock, Paper, Scissors game to pay tribute to a timeless game that's enjoyed by people of all ages. This project provided an opportunity to apply my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills to create an interactive game that captures the essence of this classic game.

Additionally, I wanted to showcase the power of front-end web development in creating simple yet enjoyable user experiences. Through this project, I aimed to demonstrate how programming languages and technologies can come together to bring a well-known game to life in a digital format.
